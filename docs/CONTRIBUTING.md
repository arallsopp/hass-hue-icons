# Contributing to hass-hue-icons
This project relies on the community to steer it in a useful direction. Your input is hugely valuable, and I've tried to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether you're:

- Requesting new icons
- Reporting a bug
- Proposing new features


## Request new icons
Hass-hue-icons uses templated GitHub [issues](https://github.com/arallsopp/hass-hue-icons/issues) to track public icon requests. Just create a new issue and the template will guide you from there.

*Please remember: This repo aims to provide icons for the Philips Hue range of lamps, bulbs and fixtures. If the device you want isn't part of the Philips Hue ecosystem (including friends of hue), it probably doesn't belong here.*


## Report bugs 
Hass-hue-icons uses templated GitHub [issues](https://github.com/arallsopp/hass-hue-icons/issues) to track public bugs. Just create a new issue and the template will guide you from there.

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
- State what you expected would happen
- State what actually happens
- Provide notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

*Please note: Do check you've followed the installation instructions fully before raising a bug. If you have, go ahead. I'm eager to help.*

## Propose new features
Hass-hue-icons uses templated GitHub [issues](https://github.com/arallsopp/hass-hue-icons/issues) to track public feature requests. Is there something missing? Something you think this library should do that it doesn't? Whatever your ideas, let us know and we'll consider it. There are no bad suggestions here.
